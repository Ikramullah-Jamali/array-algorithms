# 📏 PrintLengthOfArrays - Java Programs to Print Array Lengths 

This folder contains simple and beginner-friendly Java programs to **print the length of arrays** in 1D, 2D, and 3D formats. 

These files demonstrate how Java handles array dimensions using the `.length` property 📐.

## 📄 Files and Descriptions 

### ✅ `PrintLengthOf1DArray.java` 
🔹 **Purpose**: Print the length of a 1D array   

🔹 Output: Length of the array: 3 
🔹 Highlights: .length gives total number of elements in the 1D array 

### ✅ PrintLengthOf2DArray.java 
🔹 Purpose: Print the length of a row in a 2D array 
🔹 Output: Length of the array: 4 
🔹 Highlights: 
a.length ➜ number of rows 
a[i].length ➜ number of columns in row i 
Demonstrates jagged array (uneven rows) 

### ✅ PrintLengthOf3DArray.java 
🔹 Purpose: Print the length of a sub-array in a 3D array 
🔹 Output: Length of the array: 2 
🔹 Highlights: 
a.length ➜ number of 2D blocks 
a[0].length ➜ number of rows in the first 2D block 
a[0][0].length ➜ number of elements in the first row of the first 2D block
