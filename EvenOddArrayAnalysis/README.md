# 🔢 Even and Odd Numbers in an Array (Java)

This Java program performs six common operations on an integer array:

1. Find even numbers
2. Find odd numbers
3. Count even numbers
4. Count odd numbers
5. Sum of even numbers
6. Sum of odd numbers

---

## 📌 Description

The program separates even and odd numbers from a predefined array, stores them in `ArrayList`s, counts them, and calculates their sums. 
This is useful for practicing array traversal, conditional checks, and using dynamic collections in Java.

---

## 📄 Code Highlights

- Uses `ArrayList` for flexible storage
- Single loop to divide values into even/odd
- Efficient use of enhanced `for-each` loops
- Clean console output
