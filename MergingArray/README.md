## 🧠 Problem Statement 

Given two arrays: 

int[] a = {10, 20, 30}; 
int[] b = {40, 50, 60, 70, 80}; 
We want to create a new array that contains all elements of both arrays, in order: 

## Output: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 

## ✅ Features 

Merges two arrays without using built-in libraries 

Uses basic for loops — beginner-friendly 👨‍🎓 

Demonstrates array indexing clearly 

## 🧾 Code Overview 
First array: a[] 

Second array: b[] 

Result array: c[] (combined length of a + b) 

Loop 1: Copies elements from a to c 

Loop 2: Appends elements from b to c 

## 🔍 Output 
Merged Array: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
