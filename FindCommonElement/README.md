# 🔗 Find Common Elements in Two Arrays (Java)

This Java program finds and displays the common elements (intersection) between two integer arrays using a simple nested loop and a `HashSet`.

---

## 📌 What It Does

- Compares each element of `arr1` with each element of `arr2`
- Adds the common elements to a `HashSet` to avoid duplicates
- Prints all the common elements

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

Common elements: 3, 4

*(Order may vary due to HashSet)*

---

## 💡 Concepts Used

- Nested loops
- Conditional comparison
- HashSet to avoid duplicates

---

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
javac FindCommonElementsInTwoArrays.java
java FindCommonElementsInTwoArrays
