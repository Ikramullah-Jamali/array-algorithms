# Array Access Programs in Java

This repository contains simple Java programs demonstrating how to **declare**, **initialize**, and **access elements** in:

- 1D arrays
- 2D jagged arrays (arrays with rows of varying lengths)

## üìÅFiles Included

### 1. Accessing1DArray.java

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to work with a one-dimensional (1D) array in Java.
- **Features:**
  - Declares and initializes a 1D integer array.
  - Prints the full array using two methods:
    - Traditional `for` loop with index.
    - Enhanced `for-each` loop.
  - Accesses and prints a specific element by index.
- **Example Output:**
Full 1D Array (using for loop):
10 20 30 40 50
Full 1D Array (using for-each loop):
10 20 30 40 50
Element at [2] is: 30

### 2. Accessing2DArray.java

- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to work with a two-dimensional jagged array in Java.
- **Features:**
- Declares and initializes a jagged 2D integer array (rows with different lengths).
- Traverses and prints the entire 2D array using nested loops.
- Accesses and prints a specific element by row and column indices.
- **Example Output:**
Full 2D Array:
10 20 30 40
50 60
70 80 90
Element at [0][1] is: 20

## Concepts Covered

- **1D Arrays:** How to create and access elements in a linear array.
- **2D Jagged Arrays:** Understanding arrays of arrays with different row lengths.
- **Loops for Traversal:** Using `for` and enhanced `for-each` loops to iterate arrays.
- **Element Access:** Accessing array elements using indices safely.
- **Printing Arrays:** Proper formatting for console output.

## How to Run

1. Compile each Java file using `javac`. For example:
javac Accessing1DArray.java
javac Accessing2DArray.java

2. Run the compiled classes using `java`. For example:
java Accessing1DArray
java Accessing2DArray
